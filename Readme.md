MeshDGP is a simple C# geometry processing library. This mesh processing framework(MeshDGP) is developed by the Team of Hui Zhao. All Right is Reserved! A lot of students have contributed to MeshDGP. They are Luwei Yang, Tong Wu, Fada Li, Nan Dong, Han Meng, Xun Meng, Zihao Li, Haibo Jiang, Anan Zhou, Leyuan Liu. Thanks to them

MeshDGP demonstrates the dozens of keystone mesh processing algorithms. it could be used as a learning or research framework for students ,researchers and engineers

MeshDGP can also be used to learn the basic algorithms in 3ds Max, Maya

 ## Features
1. This mesh processing framework(MeshDGP) is developed by the Team of Hui Zhao. All Right is Reserved!

2. MeshDGP is developed with C Sharp and includes the dozens of Keystone Siggraph Mesh Processing Algorithms.

3. HalfEdge, Subdivision, Simplification, Mesh Cut, Segmentation, Laplace deformation, FFD, Green deformation, Mean value Deformation, Mesh Smoothing, Skeleton, Skinning, Morse Function, Spectral Analysis, Vector Field Design, Quadrangulation, Feature Line,GPU Rendering, OpenGL UI
